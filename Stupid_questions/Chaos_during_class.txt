Observations: Chaos during class.
Date: 2019, 2, 26
Reason: 

* Group of people easily fall into chaos;
* Fall behind the progress;
* Unexpected Interrupt;
* Hormone Influence(Maybe caused by low temperature);
* Behave without thinking;

Solution:

* Try to think all aspects of a problem before discuss it(when facing unexpected interrupt).
* Work by yourself, get away from people/crowd(Group).
* When you feel high, or excited, or try to act impetuously: 
    * Turn on Air-condition(Temp).
    * Try to calm down(don't talk to anyone else <could hurt others feelings>).
        * It may take a little bit of time to get you calm down because the influence of Hormone.
    * Listen to music.

* Avoid Interrupt && Don’t Interrupt.
    * Interrupt could leads to fail in message receiving, which also leads to chaos.
        * So, don’t talk to people during class;
        * Find a place where you could sit alone;
        * Don’t ask questions until you know what are the questions.
    * When facing the Interrupt -> depends.
        * If don’t know -> Stop;
        * If know but teacher is teaching -> Stop;
            * If not -> Teach the person in an efficient way and don't interrupt others.
